### What I learned

During this challenge I learned more on how to structure the content properly inside various divs that will make easier to postion (using flex) later on.
Using the flex property can really help you position elements with ease.
Setting a width in % with "margin: auto" is also a neat trick to align items.
I have also become more confident in using SASS. Setting variables and mixins to be used later on in styling/positioning elements.
